	"desc": "This is a project that I contributed to while working as a high school student at <a href='http://genspace.org/'>Genspace</a>. The team modified E. coli to express several different peptides intended to generate Cadmium Sulfide quantum dots. A feedback system was also designed to coerce E. coli to produce a more narrow range of quantum dot colors. We presented our results at the iGEM 2011 jamboree in Indiana, and went on to present at the global jamboree at MIT. ",
