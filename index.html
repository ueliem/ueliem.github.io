<p>At the Brouzes Lab, we are interested in developing methods of single cell analysis through droplet microfluidics. 
Aqueous droplets in a fluorinated oil carrier can be manipulated in conventional PDMS chips. 
This technique allows for tens of thousands of samples to be processed in a short period of time. 
We are interested in using these techniques to study the heterogeneity of cancer cells through analysing many single cells.
