I've been meaning to write up an introductory post to this site. I recently started an internship at Pearson on the Developer Relations team. As part of my position, I have a weekly column on the [Pearson Developers](https://developer.pearson.com) site talking about my experience at the company and on the team. I thought I would link my [first post](https://developer.pearson.com/blog/a-summer-internship-at-pearson-week-one/) there to my blog here. Inside, I talk a bit about myself and my first week as an intern. Thanks for reading!
