This past weekend was amazing. As part of my internship at Pearson, I travelled with my boss to Boston to sponsor the LearnLaunch Hackathon at Coalition Boston. It was a new experience, being my first time travelling without my family. I met some creative people and saw some fantastic projects. Limited to just 24 hours time, participants made surprisingly compelling EdTech-related projects. Read about it [here, on the Pearson Developer blog.](https://developer.pearson.com/blog/post-learnlaunch-hackathon-update/) Thanks for checking it out!
