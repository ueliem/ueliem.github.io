Today I published my [second blog post](https://developer.pearson.com/blog/a-summer-internship-at-pearson-week-two/) as part of my internship on Pearson's Developer Relations team. It's been a great two weeks. This week we played with Google's [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), which is a fantastic interface to Web Components. Stay tuned for a release of Pearson API web components!
